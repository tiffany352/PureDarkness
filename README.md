# PureDarkness

In 1.18, hostile mobs require a block light level of 0 to spawn. This
makes moody lighting possible in builds, and reduces the need for torch
spam.

This is a quick and dirty Spigot plugin that backports this behavior to
1.17.

There is a config which you can use to edit light level requirements.
Otherwise, there are no permissions, no commands, or anything. I don't
plan on adding them.
